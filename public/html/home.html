                    So I guess I should start by introducing myself, my full name is Richard Charles Sorenson the Third. I was born July 31 1990,
                    third child of Richard Charles Sorenson the Second and Jill Sorenson. I am married to Samantha Sorenson,
                    have been for almost 5 years now and have loved all of it. My early years of life were split between
                    Utah and California, and when I turned 10 my family moved out east to Indiana and later Ohio.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a fairly normal work history in the sense that like most teenagers I decided to get a part time job
                    to have some extra spending money on the side. I started working for Chick-fil-a in 2007, and became
                    a manager within two years. In 2010 I left Chick-fil-a to serve a 2 year mission for the LDS church in
                    Portland Oregon, where I served in several leadership roles and trained new missionaries several times.
                    In 2012 I returned home and started working for UPS as a package handler (I loaded semi -trucks). After
                    2 years at UPS I moved to Utah to further my education (also the education of my new wife Samantha).
                    While in Utah I started working for Chick-fil-a again, and have been there for the past 4.5 years.
